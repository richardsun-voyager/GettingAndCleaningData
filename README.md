1.output.txt the means of variables for each avtivity and subject.output.txt includes 81 columns(all of which are measures 
including mean or std except the activity and subject)
2.run_analysis.R the codes which read the original data given by the assignments and take 5 procedures according to the 
instruction, finally create and output a new data set.
3.codebook.txt describes the variables of output.txt.
